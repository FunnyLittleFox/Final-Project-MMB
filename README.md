The Inspiration
During the pandemic of 2020, I witnessed many people on social media and real life start a business in hopes to sustain an income after major layoffs and in hopes to change their previous reality. I wanted to begin this project to help guide business owners and aspiring business owners to turn that dream into their new reality.
